# Objective: Churn Prediction

## Key Results:

1.  Achieve a churn prediction accuracy of 90% by the end of Q4 2023, as measured by the F1 score.
2.  Reduce customer churn rate by 20% by the end of Q4 2023, as measured by the number of customers who have stopped using our services.
3.  Increase customer retention rate by 15% by the end of Q4 2023, as measured by the number of customers who continue to use our services.

## Metrics:

1.  F1 score: This metric measures the accuracy of our churn prediction model, taking into account both precision and recall. A higher F1 score indicates better accuracy in identifying customers who are likely to churn.
2.  Churn rate: This metric measures the percentage of customers who have stopped using our services during a specific time period. A lower churn rate indicates higher customer loyalty and satisfaction.
3.  Retention rate: This metric measures the percentage of customers who continue to use our services over a specific time period. A higher retention rate indicates better customer engagement and loyalty.

## Initiatives:

1.  Improve data collection and preprocessing: Enhance the quality and completeness of customer data, ensuring that relevant information is captured accurately to train the churn prediction model.
2.  Develop advanced machine learning models: Explore and implement state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of churn prediction and identify key factors contributing to customer churn.
3.  Personalize customer engagement: Utilize the churn prediction model to develop targeted retention strategies, such as personalized offers and incentives, to proactively engage customers who are at risk of churning.

## Timeline:

-   Q4 2023: Implement data collection and preprocessing improvements.
-   Q4 2023: Develop and deploy advanced machine learning models for churn prediction.
-   Q4 2023: Launch personalized customer engagement initiatives based on churn prediction insights.

# Objective: Dynamic Product Ads

## Key Results:

1.  Increase click-through rate (CTR) of dynamic product ads by 25% by the end of Q4 2023, as measured by the percentage of users who click on the ads.
2.  Improve conversion rate of dynamic product ads by 15% by the end of Q4 2023, as measured by the percentage of users who make a purchase after clicking on the ads.
3.  Increase revenue generated from dynamic product ads by 20% by the end of Q4 2023, as measured by the total sales attributed to dynamic product ads.

## Metrics:

1.  Click-through rate (CTR): This metric measures the percentage of users who click on the dynamic product ads after viewing them. A higher CTR indicates better engagement and interest from users.
2.  Conversion rate: This metric measures the percentage of users who make a purchase after clicking on the dynamic product ads. A higher conversion rate indicates the effectiveness of the ads in driving user actions.
3.  Revenue generated: This metric measures the total sales generated from the purchases made by users who clicked on the dynamic product ads. Increased revenue indicates the impact of the ads on driving business growth.

## Initiatives:

1.  Improve ad targeting and personalization: Utilize user data and browsing behavior to create more relevant and personalized dynamic product ads, increasing the likelihood of user engagement and conversions.
2.  Optimize ad placement and design: Test and iterate on different ad placements and designs to identify the most effective formats and layouts that capture user attention and encourage clicks.
3.  Implement real-time product updates: Develop a system that ensures the dynamic product ads are always up-to-date with the latest inventory and pricing information, providing users with accurate and relevant product recommendations.

## Timeline:

-   Q4 2023: Implement improved ad targeting and personalization strategies.
-   Q4 2023: Conduct A/B testing to optimize ad placement and design.

          <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-8">System prompts are the initial instructions that define the starting point for a new chat.

          <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-8">The quality and specificity of the system prompt greatly influence the relevance and accuracy of the model&apos;s response.

          <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-8">In Lexeme, the system prompt for a new chat consists of a combination of prompts: global, document, and action prompts. The global prompt sets the context for all the documents in Lexeme. The document prompt provides specific details that apply to all chats started within that particular document. Lastly, the action prompts serve as the final layer of concise requirements to be sent to ChatGPT.</p>
